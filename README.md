# What is 'WEB SCRAPING'?
Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications.
# Python Library needed
1. bs4 - BeautifulSoup version 4.x
2. Requests
3. Pandas
# BeautifulSoup : 
Beautiful Soup is a python package parses the unwanted data and helps to organize and format the messy web data by fixing bad HTML and present to us in an easily-traversible XML structures.
# Requests Library :
Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters via simple Python libraries. It also allows you to access the response data of Python in the same way.
